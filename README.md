# IntAlt.ResponseWrappers Solutions

This solution describes the libraries for wrappers around response information
from remote servers / servers, particularly with HTTP REST services.

## License: MIT
This might change. The intention is as follows:
* The library will ALWAYS be free.
* No support is expressed or implied.
* You are free to use this library however you see fit.
* There are no warrantees expressed or implied. It might not compile. 
It could work perfectly. It could cause the downfall of civilization. 
 Use at your own risk.
* You can fork this library and do whatever you want - even claim the 
copyright, although with timestamps and such, trying to come after me for 
royalties, infringements, or anything else won't work.
* You can make requests and even do pull requests with changes. If the 
changes are warranted and make sense, we will include them. If you make 
significant changes, you will be included in the copyright if you wish, 
and you get a portion of all of the proceeds. Just remember, even 100% of 
zero is still zero.
